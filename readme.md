# Team Memort Snipers

## Project Overview
This project is an Assembler/Disassembler for Motorola 68k assembly language. It aims to convert machine code into human-readable assembly code. 

Our diassembler takes an executable .S68 file. This program then identifies 68K assembly instructions by their opcode and effective-addressing modes. 

## Team Members and Roles
Abhishek Muthabatulla: Responsible for Input/Output (I/O) Code - Handling the user interface, file operations, and data input/output.
Rod Hoda: Responsible for Effective Address (EA) - Focusing on calculating and handling the effective addresses used in assembly instructions.
John Fadich: Responsible for Opcode Handling - Implementing the logic to interpret and generate opcodes for assembly instructions.
