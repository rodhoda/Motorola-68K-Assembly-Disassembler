# Team Memort Snipers

## Project Overview
This project is an Assembler/Disassembler for Motorola 68k assembly language. It aims to convert machine code into human-readable assembly code. 

Our diassembler takes an executable .S68 file. This program then identifies 68K assembly instructions by their opcode and effective-addressing modes.
